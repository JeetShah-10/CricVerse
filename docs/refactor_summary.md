```

#### Key Improvements
- **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns with models, routes, and services
- **Scalability**: Flask Blueprints allow easy addition of new features
- **Testability**: Business logic isolated in services for easier testing
- **Security**: Environment-based configuration for sensitive data
- **Maintainability**: Consistent structure makes code easier to navigate

### 2. Concurrency-Safe Booking Logic

#### Implementation
- Created `app/services/booking_service.py` with `book_seat()` function
- Used SQLAlchemy transactions to ensure atomic operations
- Implemented `SELECT... FOR UPDATE` with `with_for_update()` to lock seat rows
- Added comprehensive error handling and rollback mechanisms

#### Features
- Atomic booking operations prevent double-booking
- Proper error handling for various failure scenarios
- Returns JSON response with success status and message
- Handles database errors gracefully

### 3. Gemini AI Chatbot Integration

#### Implementation
- Created `app/services/chatbot_service.py` with `ask_gemini()` function
- Integrated Google Generative AI SDK
- Added proper error handling for API failures
- Ensured API calls are never made directly from routes

#### Features
- Natural language processing for customer queries
- Graceful fallback for API errors
- Service-layer implementation for modularity
- Secure handling of API keys via environment variables

### 4. Production Readiness

#### Configuration
- Created `config.py` with environment-specific settings
- Added `Procfile` for Heroku/Railway deployment
- Updated `.env.example` with all required variables
- Enabled secure cookies in production

#### Security
- Secure session management with HTTPS-only cookies in production
- Environment-based configuration for sensitive data
- Proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

### 5. Unit and Integration Testing

#### Test Suite
- Created `tests/test_booking_service.py` for booking service tests
- Created `tests/test_booking_concurrency.py` for concurrency tests
- Created `tests/test_chatbot_service.py` for chatbot service tests
- Added `tests/conftest.py` for pytest configuration

#### Test Coverage
- Unit tests for individual functions
- Integration tests for service interactions
- Concurrency tests for critical booking operations
- Mock-based tests for external API integrations

### 6. Documentation

#### New Documentation Files
- `docs/project_structure.md`: Detailed project structure documentation
- `docs/database_schema.md`: Database schema with ER diagram
- `docs/api_endpoints.md`: API endpoints documentation
- `docs/refactor_summary.md`: This document

#### Updated Documentation
- `README.md`: Comprehensive project documentation with new structure

## Future Enhancements

The new structure makes it easy to add:
- Additional API endpoints
- New services and business logic
- Enhanced testing capabilities
- Improved documentation
- Better monitoring and logging
